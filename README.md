TASK:

You are given a CSV file representing information of Lung Nodules present in patients. 
A single patient may have 1 or more lung nodules.
Each nodule has the diameter indicated
You task is to write a python program which will:
- Plot the distribution of nodule diameters and save it to an image. 
On the X Axis is the nodule diameter and on the Y axis is the frequency.
Use a bin size of 0.2mm

APPROACH:
I used the Pandas module to import the csv file as a dataframe and Matplotlib.pyplot to plot the graph.
